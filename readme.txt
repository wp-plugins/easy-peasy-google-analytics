= Why another Google Analytics plugin? =
This plugin has been created for my own needs, i was tired of manually editing theme files to include my tracking code and I also didn't want to use any of the existing analytics plugin since the majority of them come with options and features that i do not need.

This plugin does all i need with a single setting without cluttering your dashboard.
